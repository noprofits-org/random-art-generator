# Changes Made to Random Art Generator

## Summary
This document summarizes the changes made to simplify the Metropolitan Museum API application by removing search and filtering features while fixing critical bugs.

## Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Fixed undefined 'fields' variable in filters.js (lines 374-382)
- **Issue**: Variable `fields` was used but never defined, causing a ReferenceError
- **Fix**: Removed the duplicate/erroneous code block that was trying to use the undefined variable

### 2. Fixed state mutation in state-manager.js (line 231)
- **Issue**: Direct state mutation broke immutability in the `batchUpdate` method
- **Fix**: Modified to create a deep clone of state before applying updates, maintaining immutability

## Feature Removals

### 3. Removed Search Functionality
- **search-results.js**: Entire file commented out
- **ui.js**: Commented out all search-related functions:
  - `showSearchMode()`
  - `triggerSearch()`
  - `clearSearch()`
  - `showSearchLoading()`
  - `showSearchResults()`
  - `showSearchEmpty()`
  - `showSearchError()`
  - `initSearchUI()`
- **index.html**: Removed search UI elements and search results container
- **init.js**: Removed search module loading and initialization

### 4. Removed Filtering Features
- **filters.js**: Entire file commented out
- **index.html**: Removed all filter UI elements (department select, date inputs, medium select, advanced search)
- **init.js**: Removed filter module loading and initialization
- **api.js**: Modified `getRandomArtwork()` to always fetch random objects without filters
- **ui.js**: Removed filter element references

### 5. Simplified the UI
- **index.html**: 
  - Removed the controls drawer
  - Removed mobile menu button
  - Added simplified controls with just the app title and two buttons
- **styles.css**: Added new styles for simplified controls layout
